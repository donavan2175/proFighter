    <p class="paragraph">Muay Thai or Thai boxing is a combat sport of Thailand that uses stand-up striking along with various clinching techniques.[1][2][3][4] This discipline is known as the "Art of Eight Limbs" because it is characterized by the combined use of fists, elbows, knees and shins.[5] Muay Thai became widespread internationally in the twentieth century, when practitioners from Thailand began competing in Kickboxing, mixed rules matches, as well as matches under Muay Thai rules around the world. The professional league is governed by The Professional Boxing Association of Thailand (P.A.T) sanctioned by The Sports Authority of Thailand (S.A.T.), and World Professional Muaythai Federation (WMF) overseas.</p>
